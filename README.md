# VerseVibes: Illuminating the Melodies of Language
VerseVibes is a snippet of creative code that converts lyrical art into visual art.
By painting the sentiment melodies of an input text, VerseVibes allows you to see what you feel.
Play around with sentiment analysis and create art based on your favourite songs, books and poems.

## Setup
Before verse-vibing, install all libraries specified in the requirements.txt file, by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run the `setup.py` file, which will download necessary packages for the sentiment analysis. 
Two file directories (input & output) will be created. 
When the setup complete message appears, you can get started. 

## Start Verse-Vibing  
In the following, the input specifications will be explained.  
### Input
VerseVibe supports any type of text, dont limit yourself to song lyrics or poems!  
To change the text that is verse-vibed, just change the filename in the line 9 in `main.py`.   
The text should be in a `.txt` file in the input directory and start every line after a linebreak.
Despite that, the longer your input text is, the more colourful your output will be!
