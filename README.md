# VerseVibes: Illuminating the Melodies of Language
VerseVibes is a snippet of creative code that paints the sentiment portrayed in a given text.   
Play around with sentiment analysis and create art based on your favourite songs, books and poems.

## Setup
Before the vibe-check, install all libraries specified in the requirements.txt file, by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run the `setup.py` file, which will download necessary packages for the sentiment analysis. 
Two file directories (input & output) will be created. 
When the setup complete message was printed, you can get started. 

## Get Artsy  
In the following, the input and output options will be explained.  
### Input
VerseVibe supports any type of text, dont limit yourself to song lyrics or poems!  
To change the text that is verse-vibed, just change the filename in the line XYZ in `main.py`.   
The text should be in a `.txt`file in the input directory and start every line after a linebreak.
Despite that, the longer your input text is, the more colourful your output will be!
